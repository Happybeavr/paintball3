		<h2>CND Rules/Instructions</h2>
      <h5>We will have 3 areas where we will have games running, one will be capture the flag, another will be team deathmatch, and the last one is bomb. In capture the flag you have to try to make it into the other teams base and take their flag and wave it in the air without getting shot. In team deathmatch your team has to have the last man standing to win, and in bomb there will be a flag that you have to run into the enemy teams base to win.</h5>
